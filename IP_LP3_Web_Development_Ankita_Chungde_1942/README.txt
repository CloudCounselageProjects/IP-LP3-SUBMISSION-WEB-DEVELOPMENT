Q: Create a personal website using full-stack development which uses a REST API to tell system date and time by an API call.
The website should work on the localhost.
This project is created By Ankita Chungde. 
Assigment submission to the cloud counselage.
COVID-19 Website states the every detail of a covid-19.
here i used a xampp server to run the website.
After that i created a front-end of a website using HTML,CSS,Javascript. also i used jquery,Ajax and Bootstrap Framework.
Home is the main page of website. You have to run this webpage on a localhost.



HOW TO USE:
1. Intall Xampp server.
2. In the xampp folder there is another folder htdocs, place the covid-19 folder in the htdocs.
3. To start the server, click on the control xampp-control option and start the Apache and Mysql.
4. As the server started,it displays the message below which shows that "Status change detected: running"
5. On your browser, search localhost/directory_name/File_name to run the PHP file. That's it.

Now For Backend:
Create a Database to store the data:-
1.Go to the browser search localhost/phpmyadmin.
2.Now PhpMyAdmin webpage display on your screen then click on new option which is available on your left side to create a database.
3.Then create a database by filling the further information.
